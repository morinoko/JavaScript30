    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2); // 100, 100
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2); // 200, 100
    // The value of age goes into the variable at the same time. If you change the original one, it will not update the others.

    let name = 'Wes';
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2); // Wes, Wes
    name = 'wesley';
    console.log(name, name2); // wesley, Wes


    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team); // Same result

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    
    team[3] = 'Lux';

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players, team); // Both get changed!
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice(); // // leaves original untouched
    team2[3] = 'Ria'
    console.log(players, team2); // original not changed

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[3] = 'Sharky';
    console.log(players, team3); // original not changed

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'Jiro';
    console.log(players, team4); // original not changed

    // or use Array.from()
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[3] = "Sakura";
    console.log(players, team5); // original not changed

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    let person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    console.log(captain, person);
    captain.age = 99;
    console.log(captain, person); // Both changed!

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 99, number: 100 });
    // Start with a new object, give the one you want to copy, and 'fold in' the attributes you want to change or add
     console.log(person, captain2); // original changed!

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const captain3 = {...person};
    console.log(captain3);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    };

    console.log(wes);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
    // If social is changed, it will changed both objects!

    // Poor man's deep clone
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
